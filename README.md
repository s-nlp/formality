# Multilingual Formality Classification

Code for models training and inference procedure from the paper "Detecting Text Formality: A Study of Text Classification Approaches".
All the models tested in this work are presented in the folder `notebooks`.

## Dataset
The work is based on formality classification datasets:
* [GYAFC](https://aclanthology.org/N18-1012/): binary formality classification dataset based on Yahoo posts for English;
* [X-FORMAL](https://aclanthology.org/2021.naacl-main.256/): its multilingual extension to French, Italian, and Brazilian.

## Models for Classification
We bechmark various models for the binary formality classification task in both monolingual and multilingual formats:
* *Linguistic-Based Baselines*: simple presence of capitalization and punctuation; bag-of-words;
* *CNN and RNN*: CNN, Char BiLSTM, Word BiLSTM; ELMo;
* *Transformer-based encoders*: BERT; DistillBERT; RoBERTa; Deberta; XLM-RoBERTa;
* *Transformer-based decoders*: (m)T5; (m)BART; XLNet.

    abstract = "Formality is one of the important characteristics of text documents. The automatic detection of the formality level of a text is potentially beneficial for various natural language processing tasks. Before, two large-scale datasets were introduced for multiple languages featuring formality annotation{---}GYAFC and X-FORMAL. However, they were primarily used for the training of style transfer models. At the same time, the detection of text formality on its own may also be a useful application. This work proposes the first to our knowledge systematic study of formality detection methods based on statistical, neural-based, and Transformer-based machine learning methods and delivers the best-performing models for public usage. We conducted three types of experiments {--} monolingual, multilingual, and cross-lingual. The study shows the overcome of Char BiLSTM model over Transformer-based ones for the monolingual and multilingual formality classification task, while Transformer-based classifiers are more stable to cross-lingual knowledge transfer.",
